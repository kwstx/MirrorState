      # This is tricky with Next.js Server Components vs Client Components.
      # Server-side calls (from API routes) use internal DNS.
      # Client-side calls might need a public URL, but we are using a Proxy Route.
      # The Proxy Route runs on the Server (Next.js server), so it should use internal DNS.

      # We just need to ensure the proxy logic in route.ts picks up the right URL.
      # Currently route.ts has hardcoded "http://localhost:8005".
      # We need to make that dynamic or change it here via env var if the code supports it.
      # Let's assume we will update the code to read process.env.API_SERVICE_URL or similar.
